		<p>Weclome to the BaseCricks website. Here you will find the all the basics of the world's second most popular sport: Cricket. If you're a fan of the insect then you may be disappointed. You can find key terms, the membership process of the international teams, and how the sport is played and regulated. Of course this is not the complete guide to the sport. This website is only intended to help the layman understand the wonderful game billions of people so affectionately call, "The Gentleman's Game."</p>
